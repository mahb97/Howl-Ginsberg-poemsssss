# Howl-Ginsberg-I-miss-u-izzy-

Cassidy I still have your postcards

And I miss you 

or maybe the semiotic oxford cobblestones in the rain at 3.00 am by the radcliffe camera and the way life felt for one breif moment 

You by the hanging t - your obsession -

made me feel so safe bout mine

Deep springs took you and where are you now?
