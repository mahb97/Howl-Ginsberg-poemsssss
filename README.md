# Howl-Ginsberg-I-miss-u-izzy-

Cassidy I still have your postcards

And I miss you 

or maybe the semiotic oxford cobblestones in the rain at 3.00 am by the radcliff camera and the way life felt for one breif moment 

You by the hanging t - your obsession -

made me feel so safe bout mine

Deep springs took you and where are you now? 

The hanging T, the boarding house, you are there somewhere with your curls and kind face under a cowboy hat 

your Kerouac
